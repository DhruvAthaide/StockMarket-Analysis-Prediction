# Stock Market-Analysis&Prediction

This is a Project that I created in my free time. I made three different Stock Market Algorithmns, where one Algorithmn is using the Random Forect Classifier to Predict, and the other two Algorithmns are using the Long Term Short Memory Model. From the Two LSTM Models, one script is for Prediction and the other script does Prediction & Analysis also. I have made sure to use Yahoo Finance as the method for getting the stock data as that makes the process more efficient than downloading the data manually and inputting it.

## Installation

To download this Repository
You can download the zip file or Clone the Project Repository using Git with the below command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DhruvAthaide/StockMarket-Analysis&Prediction.git
```

Then open Command Prompt, in the Project Directory and proceed further with whichever Installation you want to go ahead with:
